                    The delivery system has become an almost essential service in modern society, and especially in large cities like New York, it is hard to find areas where delivery services are unavailable. However, certain individuals may face difficulties accessing these delivery services depending on their circumstances. This article will explore two main issues: the burden of delivery fees and the inability to receive deliveries due to specific situations.

                Delivery services are available in various forms, including packages, groceries, and meals, and these services often come with additional charges on top of the cost of the goods. While these additional costs are not a major burden for individuals with average incomes, they can be a significant financial strain for some, particularly those facing income inequality, leading to the inability to use delivery services. The average annual cost for using delivery services is $130, with a monthly average of about $13.
